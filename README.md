# Wordpress assignment

**Introduction**

Welcome to the test assignment for the WordPress position. Before starting please read the instructions and ask if something is unclear.
Good luck!


**What you need to do:**

Take the design provided in the Assets section and implement the steps in the Scoping section according to the design. See the remaining section in this document for additional guidelines.
You will work in your own environment and at the end you will share the results with us by showing your source code.
If you donâ€™t have a local environment, you can create one with a tool such as Local.


**Assets:**

**Delivery:**

Share the source code in a private Git repository of your making ( GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket) and send it to smartclickdev@gmail.com


**Scoping:**

-The main goal is to create Gutenberg blocks in Wordpress according to the design

-You can create your own theme or use a theme of your choice

-Create a Gutenberg block - all the text, buttons and background images must be editable in WP admin panel

-You don't need to finish the entire design, two or three sections would suffice


**Requirements:**

-Your code must be pushed to a private Git repository - you can create a repository in GitHub or GitLab and then share it with us when you are done

-Download the latest version of WordPress

-You must use ACF (advanced custom fields) plugin to create the Gutenberg Block

-You must use Bootstrap framework

-You must use SCSS for creating the styles


**Scoring criteria:**

We value good practices and attention to detail. The results should look good, behave as expected and the code should be easy to maintain and extend.

You will be evaluated according to the following criteria:

-Task comprehension - technical scoping understanding, ability to follow instructions and fulfillment of specifications and requirements

-Frontend considerations - design accuracy (we expect pixel-perfect design), responsiveness to different window sizes, use of appropriate HTML tags and attributes

-Backend considerations - knowledge of WordPress, use of appropriate custom field types, admin UX and ease-of-use ( should be easy to understand what each field does and should be well structured for editing)

-Programming proficiency - easy to understand and self-contained code, easy to extend or modify code, naming conventions and formatting

-Git considerations - each commit should have a single purpose, commit message descriptiveness and formatting ( should be self explanatory what each commit does)
